Unsupervised Machine Learning for Bank Customer Market Segmentation

I trained unsupervised machine learning algorithms to perform customer market segmentation. Market segmentation is crucial for marketers since it enables them to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns that are tailored to customer's specific needs.

In this project I performed the following:

Imported libraries and datasets

Visualized and explored datasets

Understood the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm

Obtained the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method

Used Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method

Applied k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
